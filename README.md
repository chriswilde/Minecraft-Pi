# Welcome to our Minecraft Pi Github page. #
In the links above you will find the code used in our Minecraft Modules.

In order to run our files effectively it is best to use these files in conjunction with our Build-IT world. Download the Build_IT world.py and logo's.py files and run them. You will have a model world to play with and hack :smile:

Our [Map.py](Map.py) file will take you on an interactive tour of the world

Enjoy, and be awesome!

If you notice any errors, or have alternative code, then please share.
