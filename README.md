# Welcome to our Minecraft Pi Github page. #

We have created a series of Modules designed to be used by young people to develop their coding skills using Minecraft and Python on a Raspberry Pi.

The first module can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dm-OIPIpIEhldNtLYyG_zQk2G3-rBpYdn35__dMofp4/edit?usp=sharing)

In the links above you will find the code used in our Minecraft Modules.

In order to run our files effectively it is best to use these files in conjunction with our [Build-IT world](Build-IT_World.py). Download [Build-IT world](Build-IT_World.py) and [Logos.py](Logos.py), save them to your mcpi folder, and run the Buid-IT world file. 

You now have a model world to play with and hack :smile:

Our [Map.py](Map.py) file will take you on an interactive tour of the world

Enjoy, and be awesome!

If you notice any errors, or have alternative code, then please share.
